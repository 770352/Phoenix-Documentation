# Phoenix Installation Instructions - FRC BETA 2019

## 1) Install Phoenix on your PC
### Windows
For Windows, run the latest Windows EXE found on TeamForge.  
This will look very similar to previous installers - make sure you have the relevent component selected for your programming language.

### Linux
For Linux users, unzip the Linux zip found on TeamForge into USERHOME\frc2019.

## 2) Open Your Robot Program in VsCode
Either create or open an existing robot project in vscode.  Follow the WPI Screensteps instructions on how to do this.

## 3) Add Phoenix to Your Robot Project
This has a couple steps to it:
### A) Right-Click on "build.gradle" in the project tree, then select "Manage Vendor Libraries".
